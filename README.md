# Bamazon

This CLI application uses inquirer and MySQL database to create a fake online store that is named BAmazon. 

# Customer Interface

This customer interface allows the user to view the current inventory of store items. Including item Ids, departments, price and stock quantity. The user is then able to purchase one of the items by entering the item name. Depending if the selected item is currently in stock (in accordance with the stock quantity) then the order will be fulfilled displaying the price paid. The database will also update reflecting the new stock quantity of the item. 
Otherwise, if there is not enough in stock then the game will prompt the user to update their order.
